# iOS Browser

This iOS app was built to show how to build a browser iOS app. It utilizes code to setup and render the views instead of nibs or storyboards (because I'm a glutton for punishment I suppose).

Please feel free to use it to learn iOS development or use it as a base for your own browser project.
